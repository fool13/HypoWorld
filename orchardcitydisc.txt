ORCHARD CITY STORM WARNING CENTRE
-------------------------------------------
STORM DISCUSSION - 18 AUG 2015   00:00 UTC
-------------------------------------------
At 00:00 UTC ... 18:00 FDT, there is one active tropical cyclone in the Orchard City AOR or in the Northwestern 
Fool's Ocean (extending to 30 degrees west and 0 degrees north).
OCSWC is issuing advisories on Major Hurricane WANDA (917mb), currently located at 14.5 degrees north, 98.6 degrees
west, or 380 miles east of east of Port Foy, Foy Province. The storm is currently moving north-northwest at 15mph. 
An earlier reconaissance flight found a central pressure of 917mb, and flight level winds of 151kts. This data, and
satellite imagery indications show that the storm has peak sustained winds of around 165mph, with no signs of
weakening.
Satellite imagery also indicates that the far northwestern quadrant of the storm is continuing to struggle with dry 
air, though this is not infiltrating into the core of the cyclone. Sea Surface Temperatures are thought to remain
very high, around 30 or 31 degrees Celsius. Vertical wind shear is near nil, and has been the case for the last
four days. These conditions will likely dominate in the next 48 hours, until water temperatures begin to cool
and windshear may increase, though this is in no way a certainty. This, indeed, does mean that Wanda has the potential
to remain a strong Category 5 storm for several days as it progresses towards the north.
Beyond five days, there remains uncertainty on the future of the storm, though early model indications show a 
probable hurricane landfall NW of Stanley, Killie.
Those on the east coast of the Fool's Republic, from Rushden Point northwards, should continue to monitor the 
progress of the storm and heed advice from your local National Weather Service. Interests in Killie should consult
the Killie Weather Service.
